## Description
This is an application using node.js and inquirer. We ask a series of questions to gain information about a selected type of employee. This is very useful to a manager because now all employee info is located in one place and easy to find. 


## User Story
```
- AS A manager
- I WANT to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
- SO THAT I have quick access to their emails and GitHub profiles
```


## Usage
- This application will allow user to generate a team profile
- Users will be prompt to enter a manager information
- Then user will be able to choose to add an intern or engineer or quit 
- Engineers will have all employee information including their github
- Interns will have all employee information including their school
- When user selects to end application, HTML page will be generated
- Once HTML page have been created, all the profile entered will be displayed with info gathered! 
- When user click on an email address in the HTML, default email program opens and populated the TO field of the email with the address
- When user click on the GitHub username, then that GitHub profile opens in a new tab
